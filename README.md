# pocket_sound_dnd

An intelligent way of using sounds in a dnd play

# Settings
to use it: pygame and ffmpeg must be installed on the pc.
we use:
    pygame for the music mixer
    tkinter for viewing the tracks
    ffmpeg as a  mp3 player for pygame (it is optional as long as you play only .wav files for the music)

# where you can put the music and the ambience sound files?
    you can easily put the music in the ambience_music repository and the 
    sounds in the instant_sound repository

# what must do this repository?
You can play and stop easily any sound you want using an easy interface. The music is divided in two kinds: music (infinite play, in the background, stoppable, resumable) and the instant sounds (playable with the background music).

# How to play the sounbar?
 run soundbar.py


# Roadmap:
 [ ] insert volume
 [ ] insert dinamic strings
